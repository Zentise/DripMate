## **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **Node.js 16+** and **npm** installed
- **Ollama** installed and running (for AI chat functionality)

### **Backend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   
   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   - API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### **Frontend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### **Running Both Services**

To run the full application:
1. Open **two terminal windows**
2. In the first terminal, start the backend (follow Backend Setup steps)
3. In the second terminal, start the frontend (follow Frontend Setup steps)
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

### **Ollama Setup (for AI Chat)**

1. **Install Ollama** from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a model** (e.g., llama2):
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama2
   ```
3. **Ensure Ollama is running** in the background before using the chat feature

### **Troubleshooting**

- **CORS Issues**: The backend is configured to accept requests from `localhost:5173`. If you change the frontend port, update the CORS settings in `backend/app/main.py`.
- **Database**: The app uses SQLite by default. The database file will be created automatically on first run.
- **Port Conflicts**: If ports 8000 or 5173 are already in use, you can specify different ports:
  - Backend: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port <YOUR_PORT>`
  - Frontend: Update `vite.config.js` or use `npm run dev -- --port <YOUR_PORT>`
