Project Type:    Full-Stack AI Software Application

Status:          Stage II Complete

1. Project Introduction

DripMate is a full-stack web application designed to solve the common, everyday problem of choosing what to wear. It functions as an AI-powered personal stylist that provides users with complete, personalized outfit recommendations.

The primary innovation of DripMate is its "virtual wardrobe" feature. Unlike generic fashion apps that suggest clothes the user may not own, DripMate builds outfits using only the items a user has saved in their personal, persistent database. This ensures every suggestion is practical, accessible, and tailored directly to the user's own closet.

The application is built with a mobile-first design, featuring a clean, app-like interface that is responsive and adapts to device orientation for a seamless user experience.

2. Core Technology Stack

The project leverages a modern, modular technology stack:

Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy

AI Engine: Ollama (running Llama 3 8B locally)

Frontend: React (Vite), TailwindCSS, Axios

Database: SQLite

3. Project Development Stages

The development of DripMate was planned in three distinct stages to ensure a logical and manageable workflow.

Stage I: Text-Based MVP (Completed)

Goal: To prove the core concept of AI-powered outfit generation.

Status: 100% Complete.

Summary: This initial phase involved building a "freestyle" chat interface. A user could provide a text description of a single clothing item (e.g., "black hoodie") and a desired vibe (e.g., "streetwear"). The backend, powered by a local Llama 3 model, would then generate a complete outfit suggestion in real-time. This stage validated the AI's ability to provide creative and relevant fashion advice.

Stage II: Wardrobe Integration (Completed)

Goal: To evolve the application from a simple tool into a truly personal stylist.

Status: 100% Complete.

Summary: This crucial stage gave the application its "memory." The key features implemented were:

Database Creation: An SQLite database was integrated to serve as the user's virtual closet.

Wardrobe Management: API endpoints (/wardrobe/add, /wardrobe/all) were built to allow users to add and view their clothing items.

"Wardrobe-Aware" AI: The AI prompt was significantly upgraded. It now receives the user's entire wardrobe as context and is strictly instructed to build outfits using only items from that list.

Frontend Refactor: The UI was completely redesigned, moving from a simple chat box to a wardrobe-centric dashboard where users can manage their clothes and request outfits for specific items.

Stage III: Image-Based System (Future)

Goal: To create a seamless, low-friction experience for adding clothes to the wardrobe.

Status: Not Started.

Summary: The final planned stage is to integrate computer vision. This feature will allow users to upload photos of their clothes. A vision model (such as Google's Gemini Vision) will analyze the image, automatically extract its key details (e.g., "blue, slim-fit, denim jacket"), and pre-fill the "Add Cloth" form, making it effortless to populate the virtual wardrobe.

4. Current Status

As of now, Stage I and Stage II are fully complete. The application is a functional, wardrobe-based personal stylist. All core features—adding clothes, viewing the wardrobe, and generating personalized, wardrobe-locked outfit suggestions—are working as intended.
